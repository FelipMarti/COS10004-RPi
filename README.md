## RPi 4B
### RPi 4B Material
- USB Type-C (male) to USB Type-A (male) 5V/3.0A power supply. Important: not [e-marked](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2019/07/raspberry-pi-4-uses-incorrect-usb-c-design-wont-work-with-some-chargers/)
- micro SD card (8GB or more)
- micro SD card adapter for computer
- breadboard
- a few LEDs 
- a few resistors (between 47Ω and 330Ω approx.)
- a few cables to connect from GPIO pins (female) to the breadboard (male)
- electronic buttons (for the I/O labs)
- micro HDMI (male) adapter to computer lab screens (normally DVI)

### RPi 4B micro SD card files
- [start4.elf](https://github.com/raspberrypi/firmware/blob/master/boot/start4.elf)
- [kernel.img](4B/kernel.img) - Writes 1 to GPIO18 pin (Will turn on an LED correctly connected to GPIO18)

Note that bootcode.bin is not required for RPi 4 because it is included in the [EEPROM](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/hardware/raspberrypi/booteeprom.md)

- a few resistors (between 47Ω and 330Ω approx.)
- a few cables to connect from GPIO pins (female) to the breadboard (male)
- electronic buttons (for the I/O labs)
- HDMI (male) adapter to computer lab screens (normally DVI)

### RPi 3B+ micro SD card files
- [start.elf](https://github.com/raspberrypi/firmware/blob/master/boot/start.elf)
- [bootcode.bin](https://github.com/raspberrypi/firmware/blob/master/boot/bootcode.bin)
- [kernel.img](2B-3B-3Bplus/kernel.img) - Writes 1 to GPIO18 pin (Will turn on an LED correctly connected to GPIO18)


## RPi 3B
### RPi 3B Material
 - Same as RPi 3B+

### RPi 3B micro SD card files

### RPi 2B v1.2 SD card files
- [start.elf](https://github.com/raspberrypi/firmware/blob/master/boot/start.elf)

## First steps
The first step is to check that you circuit works. 
Wire your circuit, put the provided files in the SD card, and power your RPi.
If the LED connected to GPIO18 turns on, your can continue with the lab.
If not, check if you are doing some of the typical errors:

- Wrong format of the SD card
- Wrong files in the SD card
- LED wrong connection (reversed polarity)
- Wrong wiring
- Wrong GPIO connected

### SD card format
If the SD card doesn't have a FAT32 bootable partition, it won't work.

- 1 single partition
- FAT32
- Bootable partition

#### How to format the SD card
The following steps show how to format properly the SD card in GNU/Linux:

1. Plug the USB
2. Execute `dmesg `

> This will tell you the name of your device. For example *sdb*:

> `[836119.568253] sd 4:0:0:0: [sdb] Attached SCSI removable disk`

> Some distros (such Arch Linux) might use *mmcblkXpY* notation

3. Umount all the partitions of the usb `umount /dev/sdXY`
    * X is the letter where your sd card is connected (probably not "a", be careful). In this example is "b"
    * Y is the number of the partition. You need to umount all the partitions from 1-N

4. Execute `fdisk /dev/sdX'
    * In fdisk you should delete all the partitions, command **d**
    * Create a single partition, command **n**
    * Make the partition bootable, command **a**
    * Change the partition type (command **t**) to "W95 FAT32" which is option **b**
    * Write the changes **w**
    * Exit fdisk **q**

5. Create an MS-DOS filesystem `mkfs.vfat /dev/sdX1`

6. Add the SD card files provided for your RPi to test it


## Compiler

We will use the ARM assembly compiler [FASMARM](http://arm.flatassembler.net/) running under GNU/Linux, and windows.


### GNU/Linux
You can use the binary from the [full package](http://arm.flatassembler.net/FASMARM_full.ZIP) download, or use the binary provided in this [repo](Compiler/fasmarm). 
To compile your code execute the following command:

`./fasmarm test_RPI.asm `

It will generate a binary file if it compiles without any errors.
No compilation errors are indicated like this:

```
flat assembler for ARM  version 1.43 (built on fasm 1.73.02)  (16384 kilobytes memory)
1 passes, 36 bytes.
```

### macOS
[Wine](https://www.winehq.org/) is probably the best option.
